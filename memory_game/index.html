  <p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simpy Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
  <p>Besides being fun, playing Memory is a great way to keep your mind active. Like a muscle in your body, excersicing your brain is key to staying in top mental shape.</p>
